# The_Pattern_Bug_MazeSolver
A program with a home cooked pathfinding algorithm to solve uniformly square mazes. KEA Freelance Assigment. Solo XP

Scripts are in the MazeSolver folder.

This version provides one solution per starting field of maze; future version will grant multiple solutions per starting field.

I believe the pathing-algorithm I dreamed up is a down-right-up-left-leaning depth first type deal.

If you copy the content of Assets into a Unity project Assets folder, you should be able to run the scene SampleScene out of the box (in the Unity Editor).

Program is not terrible interactive at this point (as in not, except for the Find Routes button).
